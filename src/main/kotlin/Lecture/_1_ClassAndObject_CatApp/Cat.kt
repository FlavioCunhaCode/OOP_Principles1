    /* CLASS: A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
        Here, Cat is the blueprint for all cats we create.*/

    /* PRIMARY CONSTRUCTOR: The parameters (name, age, weight)
        are defined immediately after the class name.*/
    // We use val/var, they automatically become properties of the class.

    // METHOD: A function inside a class that describes behaviour.

    // METHOD: toString() returns a string representation of the object.
    // We use 'override' because all Kotlin classes already has a toString() method.
