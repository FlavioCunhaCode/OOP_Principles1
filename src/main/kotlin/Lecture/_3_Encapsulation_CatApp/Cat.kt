    /*  walk() is PUBLIC, so code outside the class can call it.
        walk() controls how weight changes (so weight cannot become unrealistic).
        Returning Boolean is better than printing because it gives flexibility
        to the code using this class (console app, GUI app, Android app, etc.) */

        This is more flexible: the calling code decides how to display it
        (println, GUI label, Android TextView, logging, etc.) */
